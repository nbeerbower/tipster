# Tipster
Tipster is a very simple system designed around jQuery, PHP, and MySQL to allow users to submit and vote on content.

It was originally made for the Centre County Mental Health project; I have since improved it and have published it under the GPLv3.

The actual layout of the example site and code are broken/rushed, but the underlying idea is good and I felt it was worth sharing.

## Setup

1. Setup a MySQL database and run tipster.sql
2. Configure /tips/config.php for your site and database
